# A class is an object constructor, or a "Blueprint" for creating objects.
# An object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint while instance
# is a copy of class with actual values.
# An object consists of
#    * State:      It is represented by the attributes of an object. it also
#                  reflects the properties of an object.
#    * Behaviour:  It is represented by the methods of an object. it also
#                  reflects the response of an object to other objects.
#    * Identity:   It gives a unique name to an object and enables one
#                  object to interact with other objects.

# Let's create any class
